PayMe-API
=========
Class for interaction with the Payme API used in our final group project to test our ability to interact with API's. 

Check the demo.php page for a well documented start to finish interaction with the class. 
Setup is simple, just enter your own details where mine are now. Don't bother trying to add transactions to that account by the way. I've lost access to it and don't use it other than for testing.

It's not smart to copy this without asking your teacher first if you follow the same trajectory as I do since it's illegal to blatantly copy code and could lead to being expelled from the school.
